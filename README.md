# Banking-System

Designed a banking system in C++ using object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity and maintainability. The system includes features for account creation, deletion, and transaction process- ing, providing a robust and user-friendly interface. I enhanced security by implementing functionality for users to create and manage PINs, ensuring data protection and user privacy.
